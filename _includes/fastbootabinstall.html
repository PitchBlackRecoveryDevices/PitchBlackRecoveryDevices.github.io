WARNING: If you accidently flash PBPR to your device using fastboot instead of temporarily booting the image, you will need to download the latest factory image for your device and reflash the boot image.

<p class="text"><a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools">You will need the platform-tools from the Android SDK on your computer.</a> Download the platform-tools as per your operating system.</p>

Windows users will need proper drivers installed on their computer. You can try the <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/software-hacking/live-iso-adb-fastboot-driver-issues-t3526755" target=_blank>simple FWUL adb/fastboot ISO</a> or the <a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/universal-naked-driver-solves-your-adb-driver-problems-on-windows/">Naked ADB drivers</a> or the <a href="https://adb.clockworkmod.com/">Universal ADB drivers</a> if you don't already have a working driver installed

Download the correct image file and copy the file into the same folder as your platform-tools as well as device's storage. Rename the image to pbrp.img.

Now reboot to fastboot/download/bootloader mode by using adb or manual key combos (Use Google to find that if you are not sure). To use adb to reboot, use the following command:

<code>adb reboot bootloader</code>

Temporary boot the downloaded image using the following command:

<code>fastboot boot pbrp.img</code>

Preferred Installation Method:
Once booted, navigate to the Advanced > Flash Current PBPR option. This will install the PBPR image you just booted permanently to the device.

<i>Alternate Installation Method:</i>
Once booted, navigate to the Advanced > Install Recovery Ramdisk option. This will ask you to select the image you want to install PBPR from. Select the PBPR image you just downloaded and copied into device storage. Proceed to install this image.

NOTE: You also need to use the "Fix Recovery Bootloop" option present in the same Advanced Tab. Use that option after you have installed the recovery ramdisk successfully to avoid boot loops happening from installing PBPR Permanently.

After this is done, you have successfully installed PBPR on your device.
