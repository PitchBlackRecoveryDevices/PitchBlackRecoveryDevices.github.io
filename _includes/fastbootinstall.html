<p class="text"><a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools">You will need the platform-tools from the Android SDK on your computer.</a> Download the platform-tools as per your operating system.</p>
<p class="text">Windows users will need proper drivers installed on their computer. You can try the <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/software-hacking/live-iso-adb-fastboot-driver-issues-t3526755" target=_blank>simple FWUL adb/fastboot ISO</a> or the <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/google-nexus-5/development/adb-fb-apx-driver-universal-naked-t2513339">Naked ADB drivers</a> or the <a href="https://adb.clockworkmod.com/">Universal ADB drivers</a> if you don't already have a working driver installed</p>
<p class="text">On your device, go into Settings -> About and find the Build Number and tap on it 7 times to enable developer settings. Press back and go into Developer Options and enable USB debugging. From your computer, open a command prompt and type:</p>
<p class="code">adb reboot bootloader</p>
<p class="text">You should now be in fastboot mode.</p>
{% if page.fastbootunlock %}
<p class="text">Your device needs to be unlocked before it can flash custom images. To unlock your device type:</p>
<p class="code">{{ fastboot }} oem unlock</p>
{% endif %}
<p class="text">Download the correct image file and copy the file into the same folder as your platform-tools. Rename the image to pbrp.img and type:</p>
<p class="code">{{ fastboot }} flash recovery pbrp.img</p>
<p class="code">{{ fastboot }} reboot</p>
<p class="text">Note many devices will replace your custom recovery automatically during first boot. To prevent this, use <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a> to find the proper key combo to enter recovery. After typing <span class="code">{{ fastboot }} reboot</span>, hold the key combo and boot to PBPR. Once PBPR is booted, PBPR will patch the stock ROM to prevent the stock ROM from replacing PBPR. If you don't follow this step, you will have to repeat the install.</p>
